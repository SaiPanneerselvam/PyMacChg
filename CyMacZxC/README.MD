# CyMacZxC

**CyMacZxC** is a simple Python utility that reads and displays the contents of a `hardware.json` file generated by PyMacChg or similar tools. It "decompresses" (pretty-prints) all hardware and system information in a human-readable format.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have a valid `hardware.json` file in the same directory as `CyMacZxC.py`.
2. Run the script with Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 CyMacZxC.py
   ```

3. The script will print all sections and details from `hardware.json` to the terminal.

## Features

- Reads and parses `hardware.json`
- Prints each section (e.g., SMBIOS, macOS, Memory, CPU, Disk Info, Network Interfaces, etc.)
- Handles nested dictionaries and lists for clear output

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
